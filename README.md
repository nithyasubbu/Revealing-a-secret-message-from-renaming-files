# Revealing-a-secret-message-from-renaming-files
A small game - Files 

Given a folder of files shuffled (not in an order), also with numbers in filenames, a small program to reveal the secret message by renaming the files (with no numbers) and arranging them in an order.

Uploading the folders: prank(2).zip file with all the files re arranged & with numbers in their file names.
Then there are two additional folders /new_alphabets & /prank with files arranged and without numbers after the code execution.
/new_alphabets has a secret message revealed and a response from a friend after the demo is recorded as well

miniProject1.py is the python file that will directly rename and rearrange all the files in the folder to reveal a secret message and renaming_files.py & renaming_files2.py are the python files that explicity prints the renamed the files to the user console.

Make sure that the folder(With the prank message) & python files are in one folder and note the location of the folder
Then run >> python miniProject.py (After execution), check the folder , you will be able to see the secret message and the files renamed. (User can also test by running >> python renaming_files.py/renaming_files2.py to see if the user is able to see the files renamed and displayed on the user console)
